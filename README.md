# Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## üìö Project Overview

This project builds an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** model to predict **customer churn** ‚Äî whether a customer will leave a bank or stay, based on their demographics and account information.  
The goal is to help banks **retain valuable customers** by identifying those likely to churn.

The model is trained using the dataset `Churn_Modelling.csv`, which contains various features about customer behavior and account information.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Information

The dataset contains **10,000 rows** and **14 columns** including:
- **CustomerID**: Unique ID of the customer
- **CreditScore**: Customer's credit score
- **Geography**: Country of the customer
- **Gender**: Male or Female
- **Age**: Age of the customer
- **Tenure**: Number of years the customer has stayed with the bank
- **Balance**: Account balance
- **NumOfProducts**: Number of products purchased through the bank
- **HasCrCard**: Does the customer have a credit card? (1=Yes, 0=No)
- **IsActiveMember**: Active bank member? (1=Yes, 0=No)
- **EstimatedSalary**: Estimated salary of the customer
- **Exited**: Target variable (1 = Customer left the bank, 0 = Customer stayed)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow & Keras** (for building the ANN)
- **Pandas** (for data analysis)
- **Scikit-Learn** (for preprocessing and splitting the data)
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** (for visualizations)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for experimentation)

## üß† Model Architecture

- Input Layer: Number of neurons based on input features (after preprocessing)
- Hidden Layers: Multiple Dense layers with **ReLU activation**
- Output Layer: 1 neuron with **Sigmoid activation** (for binary classification)

The model uses:
- **Binary Crossentropy** as the loss function
- **Adam Optimizer** for training
- **EarlyStopping** to prevent overfitting
- **TensorBoard** for monitoring training visually

## üìà Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Measured to evaluate how well the model predicts churn vs non-churn.
- **Loss**: Monitored during training to assess model improvement.

(Results section can be updated after training completion.)
